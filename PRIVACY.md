content.

IP address only for distributing the content. However, we have no influence on
whether the third party provider saves the IP address for other purposes, such
as statistical purposes, for example. If we are aware of this, we will clarify
this in the following paragraphs.

# 27. Legal basis of the processing

Art. 6 I lit. a GDPR serves us as a legal basis for processing operations for
which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of
personal data is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract to which you are a
party, as is the case for example with processing operations which are
necessary for the delivery of goods or the rendering of another service or
consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b GDPR. The same
applies to such processing processes that are necessary to carry out
pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of enquiries about our products
or services. If we are subject to a legal obligation by which a processing of
your personal data becomes necessary, for example for the fulfilment of tax
obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c GDPR. In rare cases,
the processing of your personal data may be necessary to protect your or
someone else's vital interests. This would be the case, for example, if you
were injured as a visitor to our company and your name, age, health insurance
data or other vital information had to be passed on to a doctor, a hospital or
other third parties. The processing would then be based on Art. 6 I lit. d
GDPR. Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f GDPR.
Processing operations which are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal
bases are based on this legal basis if processing is necessary to protect a
legitimate interest of us or a third party, provided that your interests,
fundamental rights and freedoms do not prevail. Such processing procedures are
permitted to us in particular because they have been specifically mentioned by
the European legislator. In this respect, he took the view that a legitimate
interest could be assumed if you are a customer of ours (recital 47 sentence 2
GDPR).

# 28. Justified interests in processing

If the processing of your personal data is based on Article 6 I lit. f GDPR, it
is in our legitimate interest to conduct our business for the benefit of all
our employees and our shareholders. In all other respects, we have stated our
purposes and interests within the scope of the above list of processing.

# 29. Duration for which the personal data is stored

The criterion for the duration of the storage of your personal data is the
respective legal retention period. After the expiry of this period, the
corresponding data will be routinely deleted, provided that it is no longer
necessary for the fulfilment or initiation of the contract.

# 30. Legal or contractual provisions for the provision of personal data; necessity for the conclusion of the contract; obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide them

30.1 We inform you that the provision of personal data is partly required by
law (e.g. tax regulations) or may also result from contractual regulations
(e.g. information on the contractual partner). In order to conclude a contract,
it may sometimes be necessary for you to provide us with personal data, which
we will subsequently have to process. For example, you are obliged to provide
us with your personal data when you conclude a contract with us. Failure to
provide your personal data would mean that the contract with you could not be
concluded.

30.2 You must contact us before providing your personal data. We will inform
you on a case-by-case basis whether the provision of your personal data is
required by law, contract or contract, whether there is an obligation to
provide the personal data and what consequences the failure to provide the
personal data would have.
