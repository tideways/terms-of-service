With regard to the terms used (e.g. personal data, person responsible), we refer to the definitions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## II. General information on data processing

### Scope of processing

As a matter of principle, we collect and use personal data only insofar as this is necessary for the provision of a functional website and our content and services, you have given your consent, or the processing of the data is permitted by a statutory regulation. 

### Legal basis for the processing of personal data

Insofar as we obtain your consent for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data.

When processing personal data that is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, Article 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. b GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.

Insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary for the fulfilment of a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis.

If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and your interests, basic rights and fundamental freedoms do not outweigh the first-mentioned interest, Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing. 

### Legitimate interests in the processing

If the processing of your personal data is based on Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, our legitimate interest, unless otherwise stated, is the performance of our business activities. In addition, we have indicated our purposes and interests in the context of the above list of processing in each case.

### Data deletion and storage period

Your personal data will be erased or made unavailable as soon as the purpose of the storage no longer applies, or you withdraw your consent. In addition, storage may take place if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in union regulations, laws, or other provisions to which the controller is subject. If the purpose of storage ceases to apply, if you withdraw your consent or if a storage period prescribed by the European Directive and Regulation Maker or another competent legislator expires, the personal data will be routinely made unavailable or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions, unless there is a necessity for further storage of the data for the conclusion or performance of a contract.

### Recipients of the collected data / data transmission 

The recipients of the data collected via our website are primarily us as the responsible company. In addition, processors (web hoster, IT service provider, etc.) may have access to the data collected via our website. In this respect, however, compliance with the legal regulations is guaranteed by a data processing agreement that we conclude with our processors based in the EU. Data is only transferred to so-called third countries outside the EU if and insofar as this has been pointed out below. 

### Data transfer and processing to third countries

We only transfer data to a third country, i.e. a country outside the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA), or have data processed via the use of third-party services in a third country, if this is a third country with a recognized level of data protection, we have concluded a so-called standard contractual clause or there are certifications or binding corporate rules.

### Necessity of the disclosure of personal data

You can visit our website without personal data being collected. However, if you wish to make use of our services, the provision of personal data is mandatory contract execution. 

### Existence of automated decision making

We do not carry out automatic decision-making or profiling within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR. 

### Data security

We secure our website and other systems through comprehensive technical and organizational measures against loss, destruction, access, modification, or distribution of your data by unauthorized persons. These measures are subject to constant review and improvement in order to ensure state-of-the-art technology.

## III. Data processing when using our website and making use of our services Access data in server log files

Our hosting provider automatically stores access data in so-called server log files every time our website is accessed. 

This includes the date and time of the request, the amount of data transferred and, if applicable, the name of the requested file, the browser used and its version, the operating system used, the IP address, the requested URL including sub-pages, the referrer URL (URL that you visited immediately before) and the requesting provider. 

The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable delivery of the website to your end device. For this purpose, your IP address must remain stored for the duration of the session. 

The legal basis for the temporary storage of your data and the log files is Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. 

This data is evaluated exclusively to ensure the permanent and trouble-free operation of the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. For this purpose, the above-mentioned data is stored for a maximum of 30 days. 

The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is absolutely necessary for the operation of our website. There is therefore no possibility to object.
