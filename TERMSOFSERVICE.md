# 1. Conditions and Definitions

1.1. Tideways is a service provided by Tideways GmbH, Königswintererstraße 116,
53227 Bonn, Germany (hereinafter also referred to as "Tideways").  References to
Tideways encompass the software, its functions and services as well as related
websites.

1.2. "You" and "your" refer to you, as a user of Tideways. "We", "us",
and "our" refer to Tideways. "Content" means all content and information like
text, images, photos, video, messages, ratings, links or any data on
performance, a person or a location.

1.3. These General Terms of Service (hereinafter referred to as "ToS")
represent the exclusive basis for all legal relationships established between
us and you, related to the use of Tideways.

1.4. By accessing or using Tideways, you are agreeing to these ToS and
concluding a legally binding contract with us. Do not access or use Tideways if
you are unwilling or unable to be bound by the ToS.

1.5. Insofar as we have not explicitly agreed to their application in writing,
your possibly deviating business conditions shall not apply. Even though they
may be enclosed and the contract may have been supplemented, a reference to
your own business conditions does not constitute our acceptance of their
applicability.

1.6. Tideways is offered only to business customers, not to consumers.
Consumers are natural persons who conclude the respective legal transaction for
a purpose which is outside their trade, business or profession.

# 2. Scope of service

2.1. Our services include analysis services. Our concrete service obligations
to you are derived from the service descriptions on our website,
https://app.tideways.io/ as well as other agreements in contractual
offers and agreements reached in concepts insofar as these have been agreed or
confirmed in writing (all together hereafter described as “agreement”).

2.2. If the agreement is not available, if it is inadequate or if in certain
cases its scope is doubtful, the services to be provided shall include the
tasks usual within the sector which are necessary to fulfill the agreed
contractual purpose.

2.3. The contract upon which these ToS are based is a service contract.

2.4. Individual target agreements such as statistical values, growth or user
numbers do not change the character of the contract as a whole. Only where all
contractual services serve to achieve a concrete target does this constitute a
works contract. Such a target agreement must be expressly stipulated in
writing.

2.5. In addition, we owe you services in accordance with the type and quality
that are average for the sector.

2.6. Subject to contradictory agreements concerning the nature and execution of
the agreed services, we are free as regards the time and place of their
execution and have the right to make use of the services of subcontractors in
performing this contract.

# 3. Contract conclusion

3.1. The contractual relationship with us is established upon the completion of
the registration procedure on Tideways. A contract can also be concluded
by means of an individual agreement.

3.2. We are permitted to refuse the conclusion of a contract for objective
reasons. If a registration is incomplete, we are entitled to delete the user
account within one week.

and giving a password.

4.2. You are fully responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your

password. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your
account or password and any breach of security or misuse or suspected breach of
security or misuse of Tideways, and ensure that you exit from your
account at the end of each session if you use a shared computer. Tideways cannot
and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to
comply with this clause.

# 5. Legal regulations and obligations to co-operate

5.1. The provisions in this section of the ToS specify the legal responsibility
and obligations between us and you, insofar as these have not been explicitly
agreed in an agreement.

will immediately advise each other of deviations from agreed action or if
doubts arise as to the correctness of the other party’s actions.

5.3. Should you recognize that your own information and demands are in error,
incomplete, unclear or impracticable, you must advise us of this immediately
together with such consequences as you can foresee.

5.4. Our services include no legal examination or consultancy (for example, of
data protection, consumer information, copyrights, competition or professional
association nature.) You alone are responsible for compliance with these
obligations.

5.5. You shall ensure that the content you provide is free of third-party
rights and that its publication does not violate applicable law in any form.

5.6. Where we suggest content, measures or services, you are obliged to examine
their legal admissibility.

5.7. Insofar as we provide you with legal models, e.g. usage and data
protection terms, these should be considered as templates. It is your
responsibility to adapt the models to your own legal requirements.

# 6. Remuneration

6.1. The remuneration currently owed is based on the chosen plan at
https://app.tideways.io/  and is quoted net. Statutory VAT applicable at
the time of invoicing is charged in addition.

6.2. The remuneration is due to payment at the beginning of each payment
interval.

6.3. The terms and conditions of involved payment services (e.g. paypal) apply
additionally.

6.4. We reserve the right to change the scale of remuneration at any time. With
regard to current contracts, such change shall take effect only from the
beginning of the following contracting period.

6.5. You may settle the remuneration using one of the payment methods we have
offered to you. You will be provided with the invoices electronically.

6.6. If we cannot provide our services due to lacking and inadequate
co-operation or supplies from you or if we can provide our services only by
incurring additional expenditure, we are entitled to claim such necessary
additional expenditure from you.

6.7. Should it not be possible to have an invoice paid by direct debit, you
shall bear all consequential costs. These include especially bank charges in
connection with the return of direct debits and comparable fees to the extent
that you are responsible for the event that triggers the costs. We can send you
payment reminders electronically.

6.8. Should you fall into arrears with your payments, we have the right to
refuse to fulfill payments due to you and to block access to Tideways
until such default has been rectified. In such cases we will normally notify
you of such blocking 10 working days in advance to rectify such default. Our
other legal and contractual rights with regard to payment delay shall remain
unaffected.

6.9. Should you fall into arrears with your payment, you must expect to be
charged 8% interest for late payment (should you be an entrepreneur) or 5%
respectively (should you be a consumer) above the base interest rate. Default
interest will be charged, even without a written warning, if the payment is not
made at the agreed date. We reserve the right to raise a claim for a higher
value of compensation for such delay.

6.10. All contractual remunerations for individual offers to entrepreneurs
shall be subject to the addition of the legal rate of VAT or otherwise shall
include the VAT applicable at the time of invoicing.

6.11. You may offset only uncontested or legally binding debts against our
claims, insofar as these are not claims for completion or the rectification of
faults. You are entitled to a right of retention only for counterclaims arising
from the contract that forms the basis of these ToS.

# 7. Tariff changes and termination

7.1. The contract term for the use of Tideways, is determined for
chargeable tariffs by the selected payment interval. Where an automatic
contract prolongation has been selected, the contract will be prolonged
automatically upon the expiry of the contract term by the same period, insofar
as it has not been previously terminated giving notice of seven days before
contract termination.

7.2. A termination of the contract is possible at any time on the
free-of-charge tariff.

7.3. You may change to a higher tariff and take advantage of its service
immediately (described as an “upgrade”) at any time. Insofar as you still have
an unused usage quota from the previously existing contractual relationship,
this will initially be credited to you or offset against the invoice for the
new tariff.

7.4. A change to a lower tariff (described as a “downgrade”) is possible only
after the expiry of the respective contractual term. You may have to delete
certain data that exceed the volume of the lower tariff.

7.5. In addition, the contractual term is determined by individual agreement.

7.6. Both contracting parties reserve the right to an early extraordinary
termination of the contract for important reasons. An extraordinary termination
is permitted in particular where you remain in default with your payment
obligations for two months. Where necessary, a written warning concerning the
objectionable conduct must precede the extraordinary termination.

7.7. In case of contract termination, you are responsible for saving your data
before your contract expires.

# 8. Changes in service and defects

8.1. The scope of the services we are offering, the user accounts and their
technical design are derived from the current technical status of Tideways and
the description of services at the time of contract conclusion.

8.2. We reserve the right to extend, change or limit functions where this is in
the interests of technical progress, is necessary to prevent misuse or where we
are legally obliged to do so. Where such change in the scope of functions
impairs your contractual use of Tideways to a more than negligible
degree, you have the right to a fee adjustment or the termination of your
contract.

8.3. Claims for defects shall not be entertained if such defect is
insignificant, i.e. does not have a significant effect on the agreed service
and its target.

8.4. You must notify us in writing of obvious defects that would be immediately
apparent to an average user within seven working days after their
materialization and give a sufficiently detailed reason for their
rectification. In case of defects that are not obvious, the grace period for
notification begins upon their recognition. Otherwise, claims for such defects
cannot be raised.

8.5. Necessary adjustments that we could not have foreseen in the normal course
of events do not constitute defects. In particular, these include unforeseeable
changes in the legal position at the time of performing our services or
technical changes carried out by third parties over which we have no influence.

it cannot be accessed due to technical or other problems that lie outside our

network integrity is endangered for reasons beyond our sphere of
responsibility, we can temporarily limit access to Tideways as required.

9.3. You will be notified of foreseeable downtimes due to maintenance work in
good time in advance. Claims in this respect can therefore not be deduced.

nothing to the contrary has been agreed, a simple usage right will be

the remuneration has been paid to us in full.

10.4. Insofar as Tideways contains Open Source elements, the transfer of

interest in any of our Properties or any content other than your data and your
