cases its scope is doubtful, the services to be provided shall include the
tasks usual within the sector which are necessary to fulfill the agreed
contractual purpose.

2.4. Individual target agreements such as statistical values or metrics, growth or user
numbers do not change the character of the contract as a whole.  Only where all
contractual services serve to achieve a concrete target does this constitute a
works contract. Such a target agreement must be expressly stipulated in
writing.

2.5. In addition, we owe you services in accordance with the type and quality
that are average for the sector.

2.6. Subject to contradictory agreements concerning the nature and execution of
the agreed services, we are free as regards the time and place of their

payment reminders electronically.

6.8. Should you fall into arrears with your payments, we have the right to

other legal and contractual rights with regard to payment delay shall remain
unaffected.

shall be subject to the addition of the legal rate of VAT or otherwise shall
include the VAT applicable at the time of invoicing.

faults. You are entitled to a right of retention only for counterclaims arising
from the contract that forms the basis of these ToS.

# 7. Tariff changes and termination

7.1. The contract term for the use of Tideways, is determined for
chargeable tariffs by the selected payment interval. Where an automatic
contract prolongation has been selected, the contract will be prolonged
automatically upon the expiry of the contract term by the same period, insofar
as it has not been previously terminated giving notice of seven days before
contract termination.

7.2. A termination of the contract is possible at any time on the
free-of-charge tariff.

7.3. You may change to a higher tariff and take advantage of its service
immediately (described as an “upgrade”) at any time. Insofar as you still have
an unused usage quota from the previously existing contractual relationship,
this will initially be credited to you or offset against the invoice for the
new tariff.

7.4. A change to a lower tariff (described as a “downgrade”) is possible only
after the expiry of the respective contractual term. You may have to delete
certain data that exceed the volume of the lower tariff.

termination of the contract for important reasons. An extraordinary termination

before your contract expires.

technical design are derived from the current technical status of Tideways and
the description of services at the time of contract conclusion.

8.2. We reserve the right to extend, change or limit functions where this is in
the interests of technical progress, is necessary to prevent misuse or where we
are legally obliged to do so. Where such change in the scope of functions
impairs your contractual use of Tideways to a more than negligible
degree, you have the right to a fee adjustment or the termination of your
contract.

8.3. Claims for defects shall not be entertained if such defect is
insignificant, i.e. does not have a significant effect on the agreed service
and its target.

8.4. You must notify us in writing of obvious defects that would be immediately
apparent to an average user within seven working days after their
materialization and give a sufficiently detailed reason for their
rectification. In case of defects that are not obvious, the grace period for
notification begins upon their recognition. Otherwise, claims for such defects
cannot be raised.

it cannot be accessed due to technical or other problems that lie outside our

network integrity is endangered for reasons beyond our sphere of
responsibility, we can temporarily limit access to Tideways as required.
